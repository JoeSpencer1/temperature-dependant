# temperature-dependant

## Summary
My version of the neural network created by Lu et al., used to find the impact of temperature.
Lu et al.'s paper can be found [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/13/1922210117), and their code can be found [here](https://github.com/lululxvi/deep-learning-for-indentation).

## Data
This work uses different data than Lu et al., which can be found in the [data](data) folder. The data was collected from indentation tests performed on 33% TiAlTa 3d-printed samples.
